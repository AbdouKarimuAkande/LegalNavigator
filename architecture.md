# CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

## Software Development Methodologies

### Overview of Software Development Methodologies

Software development methodologies provide structured approaches to planning, organizing, and controlling the software development process. These methodologies have evolved significantly over the past decades, transitioning from traditional waterfall approaches to more adaptive and iterative frameworks.

### Traditional Methodologies

**Waterfall Model**
The Waterfall model represents a linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Phases typically include requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. While providing clear structure and documentation, this approach lacks flexibility for changing requirements.

**V-Model (Verification and Validation)**
An extension of the waterfall model that emphasizes testing at each development stage. The V-Model pairs each development phase with a corresponding testing phase, ensuring quality assurance throughout the development lifecycle.

**Spiral Model**
Introduced by Barry Boehm, the Spiral model combines elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages. It emphasizes risk analysis and allows for iterative refinement through multiple cycles of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

### Agile Methodologies

**Scrum Framework**
Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. It divides development into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.

**Kanban Method**
Originating from Toyota's production system, Kanban focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow efficiency. It provides continuous delivery without overburdening the development team.

**Extreme Programming (XP)**
XP emphasizes technical practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, and frequent releases. It aims to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

**Lean Software Development**
Based on lean manufacturing principles, this methodology focuses on eliminating waste, amplifying learning, and delivering value quickly to customers.

## Comparison between Different Software Development Methodologies

### Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile (Scrum) |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Approach** | Sequential, linear | Iterative, incremental |
| **Flexibility** | Low - changes are costly | High - embraces change |
| **Customer Involvement** | Limited to requirements phase | Continuous throughout development |
| **Documentation** | Extensive upfront documentation | Working software over documentation |
| **Risk Management** | High risk due to late testing | Lower risk through continuous feedback |
| **Team Structure** | Hierarchical, specialized roles | Cross-functional, self-organizing |
| **Delivery** | Single delivery at project end | Frequent deliveries of working software |
| **Quality Assurance** | Testing phase at the end | Continuous testing and integration |

### Detailed Methodology Comparison

**Requirements Management**
- **Waterfall**: Requirements are gathered extensively at the beginning and frozen throughout development
- **Scrum**: Requirements evolve through user stories and are continuously refined based on stakeholder feedback
- **Kanban**: Requirements flow continuously based on priority and capacity

**Team Collaboration**
- **Waterfall**: Teams work in silos with handoffs between phases
- **Scrum**: Daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives promote continuous collaboration
- **XP**: Pair programming and collective code ownership enhance collaboration

**Risk Mitigation**
- **Waterfall**: Risks are identified early but may not surface until late in development
- **Scrum**: Regular sprints and reviews allow early identification and mitigation of risks
- **Spiral**: Explicit risk analysis phases throughout development cycles

**Quality Assurance**
- **Waterfall**: Quality is assessed primarily during the testing phase
- **Scrum**: Quality is built in through continuous integration and testing
- **XP**: Test-driven development ensures quality from the beginning

## Reason for the Choice of Scrum Methodology

### Rationale for Scrum Selection

For the LawHelp project, Scrum methodology was selected based on several critical factors that align with the project's requirements and constraints:

**1. Complex and Evolving Requirements**
Legal technology requirements are inherently complex and subject to change based on:
- User feedback during development
- Regulatory changes in legal frameworks
- Technological advancements in AI and legal tech
- Security and compliance requirement updates

Scrum's iterative approach accommodates these evolving requirements through its sprint-based development cycles and regular stakeholder feedback sessions.

**2. Stakeholder Involvement**
The LawHelp project involves multiple stakeholder groups:
- End users (citizens seeking legal help)
- Legal professionals using the platform
- System administrators
- Compliance and security teams

Scrum's emphasis on regular sprint reviews and stakeholder feedback ensures all groups remain engaged and their needs are continuously addressed.

**3. Risk Management**
Legal technology projects carry significant risks including:
- Data security and privacy compliance
- Accuracy of legal information provided
- User adoption and acceptance
- Integration with existing legal systems

Scrum's incremental delivery approach allows for early identification and mitigation of these risks through regular testing and feedback cycles.

**4. Technical Complexity**
The project involves multiple complex technical components:
- AI/ML integration for legal assistance
- Real-time communication systems
- Multi-factor authentication implementation
- Database design for legal data
- API integrations with external services

Scrum's cross-functional team approach ensures these technical complexities are addressed collaboratively with appropriate expertise.

**5. Time-to-Market Requirements**
The legal tech market demands rapid innovation and deployment. Scrum's sprint-based approach enables:
- Early delivery of minimum viable product (MVP)
- Continuous improvement based on user feedback
- Rapid response to competitive pressures
- Incremental feature rollouts

### Scrum Implementation Strategy

**Sprint Duration**: 2-week sprints to balance planning overhead with flexibility
**Team Composition**: Cross-functional team including developers, designers, legal experts, and security specialists
**Stakeholder Engagement**: Weekly demos and monthly stakeholder reviews
**Quality Assurance**: Continuous integration with automated testing
**Documentation**: Just-enough documentation to support development and compliance
